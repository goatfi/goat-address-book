# Goat Address Book ðŸ“’

This repository contains an up-to-date registry of all addresses of the Goat Protocol's smart contracts, for its usage in Solidity codebases.

## Usage with foundry

With Foundry installed and being in a Git repository:

```sh
forge install goatfi/goat-address-book
```

**Import core protocol addresses from a certain network:**

```sh
import { ProtocolArbitrum } from "goat-address-book/ProtocolArbitrum.sol";
```
## Usage with node

### Install

```sh
npm i @goatfi/goat-address-book
```

### Usage

```js
import * as pools from "@goatfi/goat-address-book";
import { ProtocolArbitrum } from "@goatfi/goat-address-book";

// all variables available on solidity version are available in javascript as well
console.log(ProtocolArbitrum.TREASURY);
```
### Vault Registry

Other repositories like our api or [DefiLlama Adapters](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters), read the [vault registry](https://github.com/goatfi/goat-address-book/tree/main/vault-registry) to build data. The vault registry must be up to date with the vaults on the app.

### Releases

New package releases will happen when new protocol addresses or chain assets are added. New vaults added to the address-book won't trigger a new relase, but they will be added to the next version.

### Production Recommendations

While there is a index import available in "GoatAddressBook.sol", we only recommend using it in tests.
Foundry currently does not eliminate unused code for [verification](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/2266).
This results in rather gigantic verifications when using the index file import from [GoatAddressBook.sol](./src/GoatAddressBook.sol).
For production code we therefore recommend to use specific libraries exported from `goat-address-book` like `ProtocolArbitrum` for the protocol addresses on Arbitrum.
